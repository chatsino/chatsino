# Hooks

- The **hooks/** directory is the correct location of React hooks used throughout the application.
- Not all hooks need to be placed in **hooks/** -- hooks which fit a very specific, singular purpose can live alongside their consuming components.
- When a hook is repeated more than once, or when it contains significant amounts of logic, then it should be moved over.
