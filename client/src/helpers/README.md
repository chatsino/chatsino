# Helpers

- In the context of Chatsino, "helpers" are cross-domain utility functions.
- Generally, if a piece of functionality is only used in one domain, it can be collocated.
- Once it has become apparent that other consumers of the functionality are needed, they can become a "helper."
- Organizing in this way helps combat against circular dependencies.
